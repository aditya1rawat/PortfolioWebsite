                <h4>High School Soccer Player</h4>
                <p>I began playing soccer at 6 years old. I used to play recreational leagues before playing club.
                    Eventually, I stopped because I was taking more interst in swimming and tennis, but always played
                    for fun. When I began high school, I started to play soccer more seriously and made it on the high
                    school soccer team. We'll see what happens...</p>

                <p>I began to participate in FRC Team 3476 in 2018, and we went to World Champs for the 7th consecutive
                    time. I was on the CAD team and the manufacturing team, really creating the robot. This is my
                    first year, so not a lot. But I'm constantly getting better at what I'm doing and trying new things.

                <h4>Currently Unemployed</h4>
                <p>I began creating websites in 6th grade, starting off with template website creators, like Wix and
                    Weebly. But later, over the summer I learned how to make my own website with HTML and CSS. I worked
                    on a few and then made this one after forgetting for a long time. But now it works so, progress.</p>
