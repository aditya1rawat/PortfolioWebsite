                <h3>Swimmer</h3>
                <h4>Silver II At NOVAQUATICS</h4>
                <p>I began swimming at 6 years old. I was swimming in a seasonal league that would only compete in the
                    summer. But later, I was compelled to join a club to further enhance my swimming skills, so at 11
                    years old, I joined NOVAQUATICS, a swim club. Right now I'm in the Silver II group.</p>

                    time. I was on the CAD team and the manufacturing team, really creating the robot. This is my
                    first year, so not a lot. But I'm constantly getting better at what I'm doing and doing other things.</p>

                <p>I began creating websites in 6th grade, starting off with template website creators, like Wix and
                    Weebly. But later, over the summer I learned how to make my own website with HTML and CSS. I worked
                    on a few and then made this one after forgetting for a long time. But now it works so, progress.</p>
